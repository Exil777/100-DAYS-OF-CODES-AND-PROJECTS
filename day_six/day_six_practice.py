# creating our own function
# function are block of codes that we can use over and over
# # defining our function
def my_function():
    print("hello")
    print("Bye")
# calling the function

# Hurdle 2 practice with function and while loop
# this program allow use to mave our robots with bult-in function such as turn_left and I was able to create my own function turn_right, to allow the robot to make a right turn, and I was able to create a function name jump to create a function that allow the robot to jump over the hurdle, because if we only use the turn_left and move() function the amount of code will too much
# def turn_right():
#     turn_left()
#     turn_left()
#     turn_left()
    
# def jump():    
#     move()
#     turn_left()
#     move()
#     turn_right()
#     move()
#     turn_right()
#     move()
#     turn_left()


# while at_goal() != True:
#     jump()
